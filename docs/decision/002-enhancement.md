# Enhancement URL Normalization Strategy

## Context

We have implemented a basic URL shortening service that provides core functionality. 
However, there are several areas that need improvement to ensure scalability, reliability, and enhanced user experience.

### Enhancement Opportunities

#### Database Optimization
Currently, we're using PostgreSQL for data storage, which is reliable for moderate traffic. 
However, as we anticipate high read/write volumes, we should implement:

- A primary/replica (master/slave) architecture to distribute read/write operations
- Consider migrating to a NoSQL database like MongoDB or Cassandra for improved throughput with our simple data structure
- Implement a message queue service (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) to handle traffic spikes and ensure system resilience

#### Data Model Improvements
Our current approach using 6-8 character keys has limitations:

- Potential for key collisions will increase as our service grows
- We risk exhausting the available keyspace over time

Recommended improvements:
- Implement a time-to-live (TTL) mechanism to expire and recycle shortened URLs that are no longer frequently accessed
- Enhance URL normalization and validation logic to prevent storage of duplicate or malformed URLs
- Consider transitioning to variable-length keys that grow as needed to accommodate increasing traffic

#### Client-side Optimization
If we develop a web interface for our service:

- Move URL validation and initial normalization to the client side to reduce server load
- Implement client-side caching of recently accessed URLs
- Use progressive enhancement to ensure the service works even without JavaScript

#### Middleware and Security
To protect our service from abuse:

- Implement rate limiting at the application level to prevent spamming and DoS attacks
- Add request authentication for API users with tiered access levels
- Consider using a web application firewall (WAF) to filter malicious traffic


### Alternative Approach: Cloudflare Integration
Suppose we host our URL shortener at `superlong.site`. We could structure it as follows:

- Root (`superlong.site`) – A simple input page for shortening URLs.

- Encoding – Via a GET request: `superlong.site?url=<normalized_url>`

- Decoding – Via a GET request: `superlong.site/<shortened_key>`, which redirects to the original URL.

To handle high traffic and security concerns, we can leverage Cloudflare’s infrastructure:

- Edge Caching – Caches encode/decode responses, reducing server load for repeated requests.

- Rate Limiting – Uses `JA3/JA4` fingerprinting to block abusive traffic.

Potential Drawbacks:

- Cost Risks – Unmanaged usage could lead to unexpected fees.

- Hidden Charges – Some Cloudflare features may not be as "free" as advertised.
